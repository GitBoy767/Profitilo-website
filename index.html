                <p> I love coding! It is my favourite thing to do in life since I joind White hat jr coding classes I had a lot of fun learning it. So I got interested and started to learn more. I learnt and learnt until I made my first game. That's when I started to make more and had a lot of fun. Thanks!</p>
